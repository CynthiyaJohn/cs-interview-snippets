# CS Interview Snippets 🧩

A curated collection of **small, focused Java and Python code snippets**
designed specifically for **Computer Science and Software Engineering interview preparation**.

Instead of large projects, this repository emphasizes **clarity, correctness,
and conceptual understanding** through minimal yet meaningful implementations.

---

## 📌 Why this Repository?

During technical interviews, candidates are often evaluated on:
- Core CS understanding
- Ability to explain behavior, not just syntax
- Awareness of common pitfalls and patterns

This repository serves as a **personal reference** to revisit
frequently asked interview concepts with **working examples**.

---

## 🧠 What This Repo Focuses On

Each snippet in this repository:
- Demonstrates **one interview-relevant concept**
- Uses **clean and minimal code**
- Avoids unnecessary frameworks or boilerplate
- Is easy to explain verbally in an interview setting

## ☕ Java Snippet

### Singleton Pattern

**File:** `java/SingletonExample.java`

This snippet demonstrates:
- Lazy initialization
- Controlled object creation
- A commonly asked **design pattern interview question**

📌 *Interview angle:*  
“Why would you restrict object creation, and what are the trade-offs?”

---

## 🐍 Python Snippet

### Mutable vs Immutable Objects

**File:** `python/mutable_vs_immutable.py`

This snippet demonstrates:
- How mutable objects (like lists) behave when passed to functions
- How immutable objects (like integers) remain unchanged
- A classic **Python interview trap question**

📌 *Interview angle:*  
“Why did the list change but the integer did not?”

---

## ▶️ Sample Output (Python)

List after modification: [1, 2, 3, 100]
Number after modification: 50

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By maintaining this repository, I aim to:
- Strengthen core CS fundamentals
- Improve interview explanations with practical examples
- Build consistency through small, high-quality updates
- Develop confidence in explaining *why* code behaves the way it does

---

## 🚀 Future Additions

Planned snippets include:
- Deadlock vs Starvation (Java)
- Shallow vs Deep Copy (Python)
- Default Mutable Arguments (Python)
- Thread Safety Basics (Java)

Each addition will follow the same **one-concept-per-file** approach.

## ⚠️ Note

This repository is intentionally kept minimal.
The focus is on **understanding**, not on building full-scale applications.
