## 🧠 What this repo is
- Small, focused **code snippets**
- **One concept per file**
- Updated incrementally as part of **ongoing preparation**
- Built for **explainability**, not scale

---

## ☕ Java (covered over time)
- Concurrency & thread safety
- Race conditions, deadlock & starvation
- Java Memory Model (`volatile`, visibility, happens-before)
- Synchronization (`synchronized`, locks, atomics, semaphores)
- Thread pools, executors & futures
- Immutability, thread-local storage & JVM thread behavior
- Lock-free vs lock-based coordination

---

## 🐍 Python (covered over time)
- Mutability & object references
- Default mutable argument pitfalls
- Shallow vs deep copy behavior
- Generators & lazy evaluation
- GIL, threading & multiprocessing
- Decorators, context managers & closures
- Object identity, scope & memory behavior

## 🔁 Maintenance
- Concepts are added or refined as learning progresses
- Existing snippets are improved for clarity and correctness
- Focus remains on correctness and explainability
